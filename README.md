KURSACZ THE SECOND
==================

This repository was created for working on my second year university assignment.

THE PLAN
--------

1. [x] Implement a hash table.
2. [x] Implement a list.
3. [ ] Implement an AVL tree.
4. [ ] Implement saving and loading.

HASH TABLE
----------

**The hasing method:** closed hashing with double hashing.

**Additions:**
- Dynamic table resizing when the load is greater then 3/4.
- Linear searching by name part.

LIST
----

**List type:** doubly linked list.

**Sorting method:** quick sort (Hoare sort).

AVL TREE
--------

**Traversal method:** symmetrical.
